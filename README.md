### Hello there!

General Kenobi.

I am Livia V. I. A. Silvercrown, online known as akiraveliara/aki for short; not afraid of reinventing the wheel and addicted to making more or less weird and more or less useless things, mainly in C# (because thats a great language). I especially love working around performance in the lowest levels of C#/.NET :3
Silvercrown is a pen name. I need to make this very clear.

**Projects:** Iâ€™m currently working on DSharpPlus v6, a full rewrite of the DSharpPlus API wrapper.

**Contact:** akiraveliara on discord, though i dont accept friend requests from random people; instead you should join the one of the discord servers i'm in. DSharpPlus for example.

**Pronouns:** she/her

### Hi there!

I am Exa, addicted to making more or less weird and more or less useless things, mainly in C# (because that's a great language).
I'm also addicted to breaking Minecraft in as many ways possible! ðŸ˜„

- **Working on:** Iâ€™m currently working on InsanityBot and a certain megalomaniac project.
- **How to reach me:** ExaInsanity#1870 on discord, though I don't accept friend requests from random people; instead you should join the [InsanityBot Discord](https://bot.insanity.network/discord) or my [Hideout](https://discord.gg/PvYFD9h).
- **Pronouns:** any work though I'd personally prefer she/her.

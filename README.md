### Hello there!

General Kenobi.

I am Livia V. I. Silvercrown, online known as akiraveliara/aki for short; not afraid of reinventing the wheel and addicted to making more or less weird and more or less useless things, mainly in C# (because thats a great language).
I'm also addicted to breaking Minecraft in as many ways possible :D (not actually addicted but you get the point)

![Proof im addicted to commits](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=akiraveliara&count_private=true&show_icons=true&theme=midnight-purple)

**Projects:** Iâ€™m currently working on DSharpPlus v6, a full rewrite of the DSharpPlus API wrapper.

**Contact:** akiraveliara on discord, though i dont accept friend requests from random people; instead you should join the one of the discord servers i'm in. DSharpPlus for example.

**Pronouns:** she/her
